  Please have a look on the non-virtual @link Refinement
  Refinement@endlink documentation.

  @section General
  <!--=========-->

  @link Refinement Refinement@endlink can only be used when you know
  the geometryType of your entities at compile time.  You could
  circumvent this by using a switch(geometryType), but each case would
  look very much the same.  If you have many such switch() statements,
  or each case contains lots of code, or you simply have many possible
  geometryTypes, this can be quiet annoying.

  VirtualRefinement does all of this switch() statements for you.  It
  defines a common virtual base class per dimension, and derives one
  class for each geometryType and coerceTo from that class.  The
  derived classes simply wrap the non-virtual classes from @link
  Refinement Refinement@endlink.  This makes it possible to treat each
  geometryType (of a given dimension) the same, and thus eleminates
  the many repetitions of lots of code.

  But the case statements are not totally gone yet.  VirtualRefinement
  does these statements once and for all by wrapping them into the
  buildRefinement() function.

  @section User_interface The user Interface
  <!--===================================-->

  @subsection VirtualRefinement The VirtualRefinement class
  <!------------------------------------------------------>

  VirtualRefinement is not a set of unrelated specialisations of the
  same template class.  VirtualRefinement is a base class with several
  virtual methods, which are overloaded by the concrete
  VirtualRefinement implementation classes.  Each implementation class
  wraps one of the non-virtual @link Refinement Refinement@endlink
  classes.

  The user interface is modelled closely after the the @link
  Refinement Refinement@endlink interface.  The main differences are:

  - VirtualRefinement is not a static class, but a singleton.  Thus
    each VirtualRefinement implementation has to be instanciated
    before use.  This is done with the template function
    buildRefinement (see below).
  - Since the methods of VirtualRefinement are virtual (or use virtual
    methods themself) they have to be called like
    @code
  refinementInstace.nElements(level);
    @endcode
    instead of
    @code
  RefinementTypedef::nElements(level);
    @endcode

  - IndexVector is a std::vector instead of a FieldVector since the
    number of corners of different geometry types may be different at
    runtime.  The user is responsible to always pass the same coerceTo
    parameter to buildRefinement() so he always gets the same number
    of corners.

  @code
  template<int dimension>
  class VirtualRefinement
  {
  public:
    template<int Codimension>
    struct Codim {
      class SubEntityIterator;
    };
    typedef VertexIterator; // These are aliases for Codim<codim>::SubEntityIterator
    typedef ElementIterator;

    typedef IndexVector; // This is a std::vector
    typedef CoordVector; // This is a FieldVector

    virtual int nVertices(int level) const;
    VertexIterator vBegin(int level) const;
    VertexIterator vEnd(int level) const;
    virtual int nElements(int level) const;
    ElementIterator eBegin(int level) const;
    ElementIterator eEnd(int level) const;
  };
  @endcode

  The iterators have the same interface as the @link Refinement
  Refinement@endlink iterators except that IndexVector is a
  std::vector instead of a FieldVector (see above).  Also the
  restriction that the Iterators are not derefencable applies.

  @code
  template<int dimension>
  class VertexIterator
  {
  public:
    typedef VirtualRefinement<dimension> Refinement;

    int index() const;
    Refinement::CoordVector coords() const;
  };

  template<int dimension>
  class ElementIterator
  {
  public:
    typedef VirtualRefinement<dimension> Refinement;

    int index() const;
    Refinement::IndexVector vertexIndices() const;
  };
  @endcode

  @subsection buildRefinement buildRefinement()
  <!------------------------------------------>

  The declaration for buildRefinement is

  @code
  template<int dimension, class CoordType>
  VirtualRefinement<dimension, CoordType> &buildRefinement(GeometryType geometryType, GeometryType coerceTo);
  @endcode

  It is expected that you know the dimension and the coordinate type
  of the elements you want to refine at compile time.

  The simple case is that you want to refine, say, quadrilaterals and
  the subentities should look like quadrilaterals as well.  In that
  case you would call buildRefinement() like

  @code
  VirtualRefinement<2, CoordType> &refinement = buildRefinement<2, CoordType>(quadrilateral, quadrilateral);
  @endcode

  The more complicated case is that your entity is a quadrilateral,
  but the subentities should look like triangles.  In this case call
  buildRefinement() like

  @code
  VirtualRefinement<2, CoordType> &refinement = buildRefinement<2, CoordType>(quadrilateral, triangle);
  @endcode

  Summary: geometryType is the geometry type of the entity you want to
  refine, while coerceTo is the geometry type of the subentities.  

  @section Implementing Implementing a new Refinement type
  <!--=================================================-->

  When you write a Refinement implementation for a new combination of
  geometryType and coerceTo, you have to tell buildRefinement() about
  it.

  - First, you have to implement the non-virtual part in @link
    Refinement Refinement@endlink, if you have not done so yet.
  - Second, visit the end of refinementvirtual.cc, and look for the
    specialisations of template<int dimension, class CoordType> class
    RefinementBuilder.  There is one specialisation for each
    dimension, containing the single method build().
  - The build() contains two levels of switch statements, the outer
    for geomentryType and the inner for coerceTo.  Each case will
    either return the correct VirtualRefinement or fall throught to
    the end of the method and throw an error.  Insert the cases for
    your refinement.

  Everything else has been done for you automatically.

  @subsection Namespaces 
  <!------------------->

  VirtualRefinement does not use a complicated namespace scheme like
  @link Refinement Refinement@endlink.  The complete VirtualRefinement
  stuff simply lives directly in namespace Dune.

  @subsection Layers Conceptual layers
  <!--------------------------------->

  VirtualRefinement adds to more layers to the ones already defined in
  @link Refinement Refinement@endlink:

  - <strong>Layer 3</strong> makes it easy to use several Refinement
    implementations in the same code, when you only know at run-time,
    which Refinement implementation you need.  It wraps class
    Refinement and it's iterators into a Proxy class, retaining it's
    interface but all deriving from a virtual base class
    VirtualRefinement<dimension, CoordType>.  This is located in
    refinementvirtual.cc.
  - <strong>Layer 4</strong> defines function
    buildRefinement(geometryType), which returns the right refinement
    for a runtime-determined GeometryType.  It is also located in
    refinementvirtual.cc

  @section Implementation
  <!--================-->

  The interface is defined by the template class VirtualRefinement.
  It simply defines the CoordVectors and IndexVectors appropriate for
  this dimension and CoordType, defines which iterators to use, and
  provides some proxy or pure virtual functions.

  For each class Refinement<geometryType, CoordType, coercTo> we
  provide a class VirtualRefinementImp<geometryType, CoordType,
  coercTo>, which wraps the matching class Refinement<geometryType,
  CoordType, coercTo> and derives from the matching base class
  VirtualRefinement<dimension, CoordType>.  Each VirtualRefinementImp
  is a singleton and has a static instance() method which will return
  this instance as a reference to the base class VirtualRefinement.
  All this is done in a single template class.

  @subsection Iterators The iterators
  <!-------------------------------->

  We can't do the same thing with the iterators as we do with class
  VirtualRefinement.  Since they are polymorph we cannot simply pass
  them into user code.  They are not singletons, so we also cannot
  pass references to them.  Passing pointers to iterators would work,
  but then the programmer has to remember to explecitely delete them.
  Also, it is uncommon for iterators to be handled by their pointers.

  What we do instead is having a wrapper class which conforms to the
  iterator interface and is the same for all
  VirtualRefinementIterators of a given dimension.  This class
  contains a pointer to a polymorph backend object implementing the
  iterator.  The various VirtualRefinementImps then derive from the
  abstract backend class and pass a pointer to a concrete backend
  object when instantiating an iterator.

  @subsection buildRefinement buildRefinement()
  <!------------------------------------------>

  The template function buildRefinement() has to be specialized for
  each dimension.  It makes no sense to test for
  geometryType==quadrilateral when dimension==3.  But this way we run
  into a limitation of C++: we can't do partial function
  specialisation.

  The workaround is to create a class RefinementBuilder with a lone
  static method build() and to call that from buildRefinement().
  Since RefinementBuilder is a class and not a function we can do
  partial specialisations.

  It is probably possible to automatically generate the switch
  statements with linked lists of template structs, functions
  implementing the cases, and a recursive template function that will
  iterate over the list, but it is probably not worth the effort, as
  long as buildRefinement() is enough for the job.
