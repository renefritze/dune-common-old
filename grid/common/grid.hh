/** @defgroup GridCommon Dune Grid Module
	The Dune Grid module defines a general interface to a hierarchical finite element mesh.
	The interface is independent of dimension and element type. Various implementations
	of this interface exits:

	- Structured Grid (SGrid) : A structured mesh in d dimensions consisting of "cubes". The number
	of elements per dimension is variable.

	- Albert Grid (AlbertGrid) : Provides the simplicial meshes of the finite element tool box ALBERT
	written by Kunibert Siebert and Alfred Schmidt.

	- UG Grid (UGGrid) : Provides the meshes of the finite element toolbox UG.

	- Structured Parallel Grid (SPGrid) : Provides a distributed structured mesh.

	This Module contains only the description of compounds that are common to all implementations
	of the grid interface.

	For a detailed description of the interface itself please see the documentation
	of the "Structured Grid Module". Since Dune uses the Engine concept there is no abstract definition
	of the interface. As with STL containers, all implementations must implement the
	same classes with exactly the same members to be used in generic algorithms.

	Class Diagramm: Image inclusion see doxygen doc at page 92.
