/** \brief Mesh entities of codimension 0 ("elements") allow to visit all
   intersections with "neighboring" elements and with the domain
   boundary.  

   Template parameters are:

   - <tt>GridImp</tt> Type that is a model of Dune::Grid
   - <tt>IntersectionIteratorImp</tt> Class template that is a model of 
   Dune::IntersectionIterator
    
   @warning The name IntersectionIterator may be somewhat misleading. This
   class has neither an operator* nor an operator->. It iterates over codimension
   1 intersections with other entities and the (sub-)domain boundary.

   @warning The number of neigbors may be different from the number of
   faces/edges of an element!

   <h2>Overview</h2>
   
   Intersections are codimension 1 objects. These
   intersections are accessed via a IntersectionIterator. This allows
   the implementation of non-matching grids, as one face can now
   consist of several intersections.
   In a conforming mesh such an intersection corresponds to an entity of
   codimension 1 but in the general non-conforming case there will be no entity
   in the mesh that directly corresponds to the intersection. Thus, the
   IntersectionIterator describes these intersections implicitly.

  <H2>Engine Concept</H2>

   The IntersectionIterator class template wraps an object of type IntersectionIteratorImp
   and forwards all member 
   function calls to corresponding members of this class. In that sense IntersectionIterator
   defines the interface and IntersectionIteratorImp supplies the implementation.


   <h2>Intersections and locally refined meshes</h2>

   Consider a situtation where two elements a and b have a common intersection.
   %Element b has been refined into an element c (and others) while a has not
   been refined and elements a and c have a common intersection in the leaf grid.
   In one space dimension this situation is depicted in the figure below.

   \image html  islocalref.png "IntersectionIterator in a locally refined mesh."
   \image latex islocalref.eps "IntersectionIterator in a locally refined mesh." width=\textwidth
 
   Here the rule is the following: The IntersectionIterator delivers all intersections
   with elements on the same level and in addition intersections with all leaf elements
   that are on a lower level.

   According to this rule the intersection iterator started at a delivers an intersection 
   with b and c, the intersection itersection iterator started at c delivers intersections
   with a and d and b has an intersection with a.

   <h2>Intersections, leaf grid and level grid</h2>
   
   Note that the intersections of an element accessible via the IntersectionIterator
   are independent of whether the element results from a grid traversal with 
   a LevelIterator or a LeafIterator. For example, if the grid is traversed
   with a LevelIterator the IntersectionIterator may provide access to an element
   that is not on the same level (it may be on a lower level).


   <h2>Interior and boundary entities</h2>

   Depending on the boolean values returned by the methods boundary() and neighbor() 
   one can detect the position of an entity relative to the boundary. The 
   following cases are possible.

   <h2>Intersections and processor boundaries</h2>

   At processor boundaries, i.e. when an element has an intersection with another element 
   in the sequential grid but this element is only stored in other processors the
   intersection iterator stops but neither leafNeighbor(), levelNeighbor() nor boundary()
   are true.
   
  <table>
  <tr>
  <td></td><td></td><td>neighbor()</td><td>boundary()</td><td>outside()</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>1</td><td>periodic boundary</td>
  <td>true</td><td>true</td><td>Ghost-/Overlap cell@br (with transformed geometry)</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>2</td><td>inner cell</td>
  <td>true</td><td>true <em>for inner boundaries,</em><br>false <em>otherwise</em></td>
  <td>the neighbor entity</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
  <td>3</td><td>domain boundary</td>
  <td>false</td><td>true</td><td><em>undefined</em></td></tr>

  <tr>
  <td>4</td><td>processor boundary</td>
  <td>false</td><td>true <em>for inner boundaries,</em><br>false <em>otherwise</em></td>
  <td><em>undefined</em></td></tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Handling periodic boundaries</h2>
  - The IntersectionIterator stops at periodic boundaries
  - periodic grids are handled in correspondence to parallel grids
  - %At the periodic boundary one can adjust an overlap- or ghost-layer.
  - outer() returns a ghost or overlap cell (for ghost and overlap look into the documentation of the parallel grid interface)
  - outer() cell has a periodically transformed geometry (so that one does not see a jump or something like that)
  - outer() cell has its own index
  - outer() cell has the same id as the corresponding "original" cell

  <h2>Handling physical boundaries</h2>
  - We require differently constructed geometries outside the domain
  - The kind of construction depends on the problem ine is discretizing
  - Therefor these constructions can't be part of the Grid interface
  - Utility classes are required to do this construction
  - The utility classes must be parametrized with the intersection (in our case the IntersectionIterator)
  - The utility classen return a suitable transformation of of the inner() entitys geometry (with respect to the intersection)
   - reflection at the intersection
   - point reflection
   - reflection combined with translation
   - ...

  <h2>Identifying boundaries</h2> As long we don't have a domain
  interface in Dune one can only identify a boundary by it's
  boundaryId().
