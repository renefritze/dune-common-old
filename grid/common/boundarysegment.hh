    /** \brief Base class for classes implementing geometries of boundary segments

    Some grid implementations, as for example UGGrid, allow to use boundary segments of
    arbitrary geometry.  That means that you can have grid boundaries approach smooth
    shapes when refining the grid.
    
    Such curved boundary segments are specified by giving classes that implement them.
    Each boundary segment is implemented by an object of a class derived from 
    BoundarySegment.  The set of these objects is handed over to the grid upon grid
    construction.
