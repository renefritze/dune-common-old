        /** \brief Read a grid with a parametrized boundary

        UGGrid supports grids where each grid boundary segment carries a
        function describing the true shape of the boundary segment.  
        This information will the be considered when refining the grid.

        In 
        <em>'Sander, Krause, Automatic Construction of Boundary Parametrizations
        for Geometric Multigrid Solvers, CVS, 2005'</em>, 
        the authors describe a
        way to automatically build such boundary descriptions.  Their
        file format can be read by this routine to be used with a UGGrid.

        \attention This is a somewhat experimental feature.  To use it, you 
        have to have the psurface library and build Dune with --with-psurface.
        Ask Oliver sander@math.fu-berlin.de for help.
