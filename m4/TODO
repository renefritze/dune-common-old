- use ax_check_gl from autoconf-archive. maybe fixes:

- the nVidia-libGL seems to need a -pthread... find out more about this

- provide a wrapper for ACX_MPI called DUNE_PATH_MPI (should also fix
  the aclocal-1.4-problem)

- do we perhaps need -ldl for Grape? libltdl instead? What about -Wl,-rpath?
