  standard debug streams with level below MINIMAL_DEBUG_LEVEL will
  collapse to doing nothing if output is requested.

  For a Dune-Release this should be set to at least 4 so that only
  important messages are active. Dune-developers may adapt this
  setting to their debugging needs locally

  Keep in mind that libdune has to be recompiled if this value is changed!



  The singleton instances of the available debug streams can befound in 
  the \ref DebugOut "Standard Debug Streams" module
