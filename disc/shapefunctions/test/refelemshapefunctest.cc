    \brief Test for a segmentation fault caused by the interplay 
    between reference elements and shape functions

    On some compilers, e.g., g++-4.0 and some optimization levels :-) the code in this test
    used to produce a segfault.  This was apparently due to initialization
    order subtilities.
