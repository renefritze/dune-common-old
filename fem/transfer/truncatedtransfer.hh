/** \brief Restriction and prolongation operator for truncated multigrid
 *
 * This class provides prolongation and restriction operators for truncated
 * multigrid.  That means that you can explicitly switch off certain
 * fine grid degrees-of-freedom.  This often leads to better coarse
 * grid corrections when treating obstacle problems.  For an introduction
 * to the theory of truncated multigrid see 'Adaptive Monotone Multigrid
 * Methods for Nonlinear Variational Problems' by R. Kornhuber.
 *
 * Currently only works for first-order Lagrangian elements!
